# Account Frontend

This is a shell webapp using:
- [Sytled Components](https://emotion.sh)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

This is probably a good chance for people to look at it and give any opinions before we get much further.

## How to install

1. Add `account.thegulocal.com` to `/etc/hosts`
1. In `./nginx` run `./setup.sh`.
1. In `./app`, run `nvm use`, `yarn` and `yarn watch`.
